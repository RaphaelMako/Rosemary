This is a budgeting app made to replace Mint. I went with my another herb - Thyme

A few years ago I was using a budgeting app called Mint, which was truly everything you could have wanted in a budgeting app. Unfortunately, as is what happens with all good things in a capitalist economy - it wasn't profitable and eventually got shut down. Since then, I've searched for other alternatives but none have been as good, and all the options that were half-decent cost money... Which feels ridiculous since the whole point of budgeting apps is that you save money. 
I've decided to make my own version. My plans as of the time I'm starting this repo (September 21st 2024) is to make an app that runs locally so that you don't need to worry about any scary hacking that will steal your information.
Lets GO!
